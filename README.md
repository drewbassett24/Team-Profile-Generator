## Installation
To install the app, you need to clone the repo and intall Node Package Manager, then inquirer and fs. You can then run it in the command line, using Node index.js.


## Usage
Use this app to quickly generate a profile that includes a variety of job-related information on a group of employees, including  name, role within the team, i.d., officeNumber, GitHub username and, for the intern, school. This app allows the selection of as many Engineers of Interns as the user wishes, but the team can only include one Manager.

## Contributions

None, so far.

## Testing
I tried to use JEst for testing the app but couldn't get it to work. For some reason, Node would not recognise or could not find the jest module. This is domehting to improve on in the future.
